== Customising Virtual Machine Provisioning

In link:../vm_provision_state_machine/chapter.asciidoc[The VM Provision State Machine] we saw how the VM provision state machine was designed to be customisable. In this chapter we'll go through the steps involved in copying and extending the state machine to add a second hard disk to the virtual machine. This is a simple example, but a typical real-world requirement.

=== Scenario

We are using an RHEV provider with our ManageIQ installation, and we can successfully provision virtual machines using *Native Clone* provision type from fully configured RHEV templates. The templates all have a single 30GB thin-provisioned hard drive.

=== Task

We would like all virtual machines provisioned from these templates to have a second 30GB hard drive added automatically during provisioning. The second drive should be created in the same RHEV storage domain as the first drive, (i.e. not hardcoded to a storage domain).

=== Methodology

Edit the _VMProvision_VM_ state machine to add two new states to perform the task. We'll add the second disk using the RHEV RESTful API, using credentials stored for the provider. We can achieve this in a series of steps.

==== Step 1. Extend the State Machine

We're going to extend the VM provisioning state machine by adding states, but we cannot do this to the state machine in the locked _ManageIQ_ domain. 

===== Copy the State Machine

The first thing that we must do is copy the _ManageIQ/Infrastructure/VM/Provisioning/StateMachines/VMProvision_VM/Provision VM from Template (template)_ state machine instance into our own _ACME_ domain so that we can edit the schema.

===== Edit the schema

Now we edit the schema of the copied class (see <<i2>>).

===== Add the new states

We add two more steps, *AddDisk* and *StartVM* to the bottom of the schema (see <<i3>>).

[[i3]]
.Adding two further states

{zwsp} +

===== Adjust the sequence

Now we adjust the class schema sequence so that our new states come after **PostProvision** (see <<i4>>).

{zwsp} +

==== Step 2. Disable Auto-Power-On

We're going to override the default behaviour of the VM provisioning workflow which is to auto-start a VM after provisioning. We do this because we want to add our new disk with the VM powered off, and then power on the VM ourselves afterwards.

===== Copy the method

We copy the _/Infrastructure/VM/Provisioning/StateMachines/Methods/redhat_CustomizeRequest_ method from the _ManageIQ_ domain (if we're using ManageIQ) or from the _RedHat_ domain (if we're using CloudForms) into ours (see <<i5>>).

[NOTE]
The _RedHat_ domain contains an enhanced version of _redhat_CustomizeRequest_. We must ensure that we copy and extend the correct version for our product.

[[i5]]
.Copying the redhat_CustomizeRequest method into our own domain
image::images/ss5.png[Screenshot,350,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

===== Edit the method

We edit _redhat_CustomizeRequest_ to set the options hash key `:vm_auto_start` to be `false`. We must do this after the line:

[source,ruby]
----
prov = $evm.root["miq_provision"]
----

The additional lines are as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
# Get provisioning object
prov = $evm.root["miq_provision"]

####  Add the following lines
# Set the autostart parameter to false so that RHEV won't start the VM directly
$evm.log(:info, "Setting vm_auto_start to false")
prov.set_option(:vm_auto_start, false)
####  End of additional lines

----

==== Step 3. Create Our New Instances and Methods

We'll create a new namespace _Integration/RedHat_ in our own domain, and create a simple one-field _Methods_ class as we did in link:../writing_running_our_own_automation_scripts/chapter.asciidoc[Writing and Running Our Own Automation Scripts]. We add two new instances _AddDisk_ and _StartVM_, and two new methods _add_disk_ and _start_vm_ to this class (see <<i6>>).

[[i6]]
.Adding two new instances and methods
image::images/ss6.png[Screenshot,320,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

Next we'll examine the interesting parts of the code in each of the methods.

===== add_disk

_add_disk_ defines its own method `call_rhev` that handles the REST communication with the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualizaton Manager:

[source,ruby]
----
  def call_rhev(servername, username, password, action,
                ref=nil, body_type=:xml, body=nil)
    #
    # If ref is a url then use that one instead
    #
    unless ref.nil?
      url = ref if ref.include?('http')
    end
    url ||= "https://#{servername}#{ref}"
    
    params = {
      :method => action,
      :url => url,
      :user => username,
      :password => password,
      :headers => { :content_type=>body_type, :accept=>:xml },
      :verify_ssl => false
    }
    params[:payload] = body if body
    rest_response = RestClient::Request.new(params).execute
    #
    # RestClient raises an exception for us on any non-200 error
    #
    return rest_response
  end
----

In the main section of code we account for the fact that we're allowing _add_disk_ to be callable in either of two ways: from a button on a virtual machine in the WebUI, or as part of the VM provision workflow. (see link:../ways_of_entering_automate/chapter.asciidoc[Ways of Entering Automate]). We first need to find out how _add_disk_ has been called, and retrieve the virtual machine service model object accordingly. 

We also need to determine the new disk size. If _add_disk_ has been called from a button, the new disk size will have been passed as a service dialog element. If it's called as part of a VM provisioning operation we'll hardcode this as the NEW_DISK_SIZE constant (for this example it's 30GB):

[source,ruby]
----
  case $evm.root['vmdb_object_type']
  when 'miq_provision'                  # called from a VM provision workflow
    vm = $evm.root['miq_provision'].destination
    disk_size_bytes = NEW_DISK_SIZE * 1024**3
  when 'vm'
    vm = $evm.root['vm']                # called from a button
    disk_size_bytes = $evm.root['dialog_disk_size_gb'].to_i * 1024**3
  end
----

We're going to create the new disk on the same storage domain as the existing first disk, so we need to find the existing storage domain details:

[source,ruby]
----
  storage_id = vm.storage_id rescue nil
  #
  # Extract the RHEV-specific Storage Domain ID
  #
  unless storage_id.nil? || storage_id.blank?
    storage = $evm.vmdb('storage').find_by_id(storage_id)
    storage_domain_id = storage.ems_ref.match(/.*\/(\w.*)$/)[1]
  end
----

Next we extract the credentials of the RHEV Manager (from the _ext_management_system_ object), as we'll need to use these when we make the REST call. We also build our XML payload using the _Nokogiri_ gem:

[source,ruby]
----
  unless storage_domain_id.nil?
    #
    # Extract the IP address and credentials for the RHEV provider
    #
    servername = vm.ext_management_system.ipaddress ||
                                            vm.ext_management_system.hostname
    username = vm.ext_management_system.authentication_userid
    password = vm.ext_management_system.authentication_password

    builder = Nokogiri::XML::Builder.new do |xml|
      xml.disk {
        xml.storage_domains {
          xml.storage_domain :id => storage_domain_id
        }
        xml.size disk_size_bytes
        xml.type 'system'
        xml.interface 'virtio'
        xml.format 'cow'
        xml.bootable 'false'
      }
    end

    body = builder.to_xml
----

We make the REST call to the RHEV Manager, and parse the response:
    
[source,ruby]
----    
    $evm.log(:info,
              "Adding #{disk_size_bytes / 1024**3} GByte disk to VM: #{vm.name}")
    response = call_rhev(servername, username, password, :post, \
                                               "#{vm.ems_ref}/disks", :xml, body)
    #
    # Parse the response body XML
    #
    doc = Nokogiri::XML.parse(response.body)
----

The initial response back from the API contains some hrefs that we need to use, so we extract those:
    
[source,ruby]
---- 
    #
    # Pull out some reusable hrefs from the initial response
    #
    disk_href = doc.at_xpath("/disk")['href']
    creation_status_href = \
                       doc.at_xpath("/disk/link[@rel='creation_status']")['href']
    activate_href = doc.at_xpath("/disk/actions/link[@rel='activate']")['href']
----

We poll the API for the completion status:

[NOTE]
It's not good practice to `sleep` in an Automate method. For simplicity in this example we're handling the sleep -> retry counter logic ourselves to avoid the possibility of sleeping forever. In a production environment we'd use the built-in state machine retry logic to handle this for us.

[source,ruby]
---- 
    #
    # Validate the creation_status (wait for up to a minute)
    #
    creation_status = doc.at_xpath("/disk/creation_status/state").text
    counter = 13
    while creation_status != "complete"
      counter -= 1
      if counter == 0
        raise "Timeout waiting for new disk creation_status to reach \
                              \"complete\": Creation Status = #{creation_status}"
      else
        sleep 5
        response = call_rhev(servername, username, password, :get, 
                                                 creation_status_href, :xml, nil)
        doc = Nokogiri::XML.parse(response.body)
        creation_status = doc.at_xpath("/creation/status/state").text
      end
    end
----

If the disk has been attached to a powered-on VM (as it may have been if the method is called from a button), we would need to activate the disk in RHEV. If the VM is powered off when the disk is added, this stage is unnecessary:

[source,ruby]
---- 
    #
    # Disk has been created successfully,
    # now check its activation status and if necessary activate it
    #
    response = call_rhev(servername, username, password, :get,
                                                            disk_href, :xml, nil)
    doc = Nokogiri::XML.parse(response.body)
    if doc.at_xpath("/disk/active").text != "true"
      $evm.log(:info, "Activating disk")
      body = "<action/>"
      response = call_rhev(servername, username, password, :post,
                                                        activate_href, :xml, body)
    else
      $evm.log(:info, "New disk already active")
    end
  end
  #
  # Exit method
  #
  $evm.root['ae_result'] = 'ok'
  exit MIQ_OK
----

===== start_vm

The code for *start_vm* is as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
begin
  vm = $evm.root['miq_provision'].destination
  $evm.log(:info, "Current VM power state = #{vm.power_state}")
  unless vm.power_state == 'on'
    vm.start
    vm.refresh
    $evm.root['ae_result'] = 'retry'
    $evm.root['ae_retry_interval'] = '30.seconds'
  else
    $evm.root['ae_result'] = 'ok'
  end

rescue => err
  $evm.log(:error, "[#{err}]\n#{err.backtrace.join("\n")}")
  $evm.root['ae_result'] = 'error'
end
----

==== Step 4. Add Our New Instances to the Copied State Machine

Now we edit our copied _Provision VM from Template_ state machine instance to add the *AddDisk* and *StartVM* instance URIs to the appropriate steps (see <<i7>>).

[[i7]]

==== Step 5. Provision a Virtual Machine

We'll provision a VM to test this. We should see that the VM is not immediately started after creation, and suitable messages in _automation.log_ show that our additional methods are working:

....
...<AEMethod add_disk> Adding 30GB disk to VM: rhel7srv006
...<AEMethod add_disk> Creation Status: pending
...<AEMethod add_disk> Creation Status: complete
...<AEMethod add_disk> New disk already active
...
...<AEMethod start_vm> Current VM power state = off
...<AEMethod start_vm> Current VM power state = unknown
...<AEMethod start_vm> Current VM power state = on
....

We can take a look at the number of disks in the virtual machine Details page in the ManageIQ WebUI (see <<i8>>).

[[i8]]

{zwsp} +

Here we see the second disk attached to the virtual machine. Our modified VM provisioning workflow has been successful.

=== Summary

This chapter has shown how we can extend the provisioning state machine to add our own workflow stages. Although this has been a simple example, some kind of provisioning workflow extension is very common in practice. We see another example in link:../integrating_with_satellite_6_during_provisioning/chapter.asciidoc[Integrating with Satellite 6 During Provisioning] where we extend the workflow to register our newly provisioned virtual machine with a Satellite 6 server.

The example has also shown the _Integration_ functionality of CloudForms/ManageIQ, and how we can use API calls - in this case using the REST client - to extend our workflows into the wider enterprise.
