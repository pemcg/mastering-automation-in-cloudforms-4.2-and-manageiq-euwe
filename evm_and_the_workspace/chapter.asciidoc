== $evm and the Workspace

When we write automation scripts, we access the Automation Engine and all of its objects through a single `$evm` variable footnote:[The original ManageIQ product was called _Enterprise Virtualization Manager_, often abbreviated to "EVM".]. This is sometimes referred to as the _Workspace_.

As discussed in link:../peeping_under_the_hood/chapter.asciidoc[Peeping Under the Hood], the `$evm` variable is a _DRb::DRbObject_ object representing a dRuby client connection back to the Automation Engine. The object at the dRuby server side of our `$evm` variable is an instance of an `MiqAeService` object, which contains over 40 methods. In practice we generally use only a few of these methods, most commonly:

....
$evm.root
$evm.object
$evm.current (this is equivalent to calling $evm.object(nil))
$evm.parent
$evm.log
$evm.vmdb
$evm.execute
$evm.instantiate
....

We will look at these methods in more detail in the next sections.

=== $evm.log

`$evm.log` is a simple method that we've used already. It writes a message to _automation.log_, and accepts two arguments: a log level and the text string to write. The log level can be written as a Ruby symbol (e.g. `:info`, `:warn`), or as a text string (e.g. "info", "warn").

=== $evm.root

`$evm.root` is the method that returns to us the root object in the workspace (environment, variables, linked objects etc.). This is the instance whose invocation took us into the Automation Engine. From `$evm.root` we can access other service model objects such as `$evm.root['vm']`, `$evm.root['user']`, or `$evm.root['miq_request']` (the actual objects available depend on the context of the Automate tasks that we are performing).

`$evm.root` contains a lot of useful information that we use programmatically to establish our running context - for example to see if we've been called by an API call or from a button (see also link:../investigative_debugging/chapter.asciidoc[Investigative Debugging])

----
$evm.root['vmdb_object_type'] = vm   (type: String)
...
$evm.root['ae_provider_category'] = infrastructure   (type: String)
...
$evm.root.namespace = ManageIQ/SYSTEM   (type: String)
$evm.root['object_name'] = Request   (type: String)
$evm.root['request'] = Call_Instance   (type: String)
$evm.root['instance'] = object_walker   (type: String)
----

`$evm.root` also contains any variables that were defined on our entry into the Automation Engine, such as the `$evm.root['dialog*']` variables that were defined from our service dialog.

=== $evm.object, $evm.current and $evm.parent

As we saw, `$evm.root` returns to us the object representing the instance that was launched when we entered Automate. Many instances have schemas that contain relationships to other instances, and as each relationship is followed, a new child object is created under the calling object to represent the called instance. These objects all live in the same workspace, they share the same `$evm` variable. Fortunately we can access any of the objects in this parent-child hierarchy using `$evm.object`.

Calling `$evm.object` with no arguments returns the currently instantiated/running instance. As automation scripters we can think of this as "our currently running code", and we can access it using the alias `$evm.current`. When we wanted to access our schema variable __username__, we accessed it using `$evm.object['username']`.

We can access our parent object (the one that called us) using `$evm.object("..")`, or the alias `$evm.parent`.

[NOTE]
`$evm.root` is the same as `$evm.object("/")`

When we ran our first example script, __hello_world__ (from Simulation), we specified an entry point of _/System/Process/Request_, and our Request was to an instance called _Call_Instance_. We passsed to this the namespace, class and instance that we wanted it to run (via a relationship).

This would have resulted in an object hierarchy (when viewed from the _hello_world_ method) as follows:

....
     --- object hierarchy ---
     $evm.root = /ManageIQ/SYSTEM/PROCESS/Request
       $evm.parent = /ManageIQ/System/Request/Call_Instance
         $evm.object = /ACME/General/Methods/hello_world
....

=== $evm.vmdb

`$evm.vmdb` is a useful method that can be used to retrieve any _service model_ object (see link:../service_models/chapter.asciidoc[Service Models]). The method can be called with one or two arguments. 

==== Single Argument Form

When called with a single argument, the method returns the generic service model object type, and we can use any of the Rails helper methods (see link:../peeping_under_the_hood/chapter.asciidoc[Peeping Under the Hood]) to search by database column name:

[source,ruby]
----
vm = $evm.vmdb('vm').find_by_name('websrv031')
vm = $evm.vmdb('vm').where(:name => 'websrv031')
$evm.vmdb(:EmsCluster).all.each do |cluster|
----

We can also use more advanced query syntax to return results based on multiple conditions, for example:

[source,ruby]
----
$evm.vmdb(:CloudTenant).where(["ems_id = ? AND name = ?", 2, 'admin'])
----

The service model object name can be specified in CamelCase (e.g. 'AvailabilityZone') or snake_case (e.g. 'availability_zone'), and can be a string or symbol.

==== Two-Argument Form

If we wish to find an object by its ID, we can use the two argument form of the call. When called with two arguments, the second argument should be the service model ID to search for, like so:

[source,ruby]
----
owner = $evm.vmdb('user', evm_owner_id)
----

We should exercise caution when using the two-argument form. If there is no service model matching the specified ID, the method will raise a `MiqAeException::ServiceNotFound` exception rather than return `nil`. We can guard against this by catching the exception ourselves, as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
owner = $evm.vmdb('user', evm_owner_id) rescue nil
----

'''
.VM or Template?
****
*Question:* When should we use 'vm' (`:Vm`) or 'vm_or_template' (`:VmOrTemplate`) in our `$evm.vmdb` searches?

*Answer:* Searching for a 'vm_or_template' (`MiqAeServiceVmOrTemplate`) object will return both virtual machines _and_ templates that satisfy the search criteria, whereas searching for a 'vm' object (`MiqAeServiceVm`) will only return virtual machines. Think about whether you need both returned.

There are some subtle differences between the objects. `MiqAeServiceVm` is a subclass of `MiqAeServiceVmOrTemplate` that adds 2 additional methods that are not relevant for templates: `add_to_service` and `remove_from_service`.

Both `MiqAeServiceVmOrTemplate` and `MiqAeServiceVm` have a boolean attribute `template`, which is _true_ for an image or template, and _false_ for a VM.

=== $evm.execute

We can use `$evm.execute` to call one of 13 miscellaneous but useful methods. The methods are defined in service model called _Methods_ (`MiqAeServiceMethods`), and are as follows:

* `send_email(to, from, subject, body, content_type = nil)`
* `snmp_trap_v1(inputs)`
* `snmp_trap_v2(inputs)`
* `category_exists?(category)`
* `category_create(options = {})`
* `tag_exists?(category, entry)`
* `tag_create(category, options = {})`
* `service_now_eccq_insert(server, username, password, agent, queue, topic, name, source, *params)`
* `service_now_task_get_records(server, username, password, *params)`
* `service_now_task_update(server, username, password, *params)`
* `service_now_task_service(service, server, username, password, *params)`
* `create_provision_request(*args)`
* `create_automation_request(options, userid = "admin", auto_approve = false)`


==== Examples

We can see some examples of calling these methods.

===== Creating a tag if one doesn't already exist

[source,ruby]
----
unless $evm.execute('tag_exists?', 'cost_centre', '3376')
  $evm.execute('tag_create', "cost_centre", :name => '3376',
                                            :description => '3376')
end
----

In this example we call the `tag_exists?` method to see if the tag 'cost_centre/3376' exists. If it doesn't (i.e. `tag_exists?` returns `false`), then we call the `tag_create` method to create the tag, passing the tag category arguments, `:name` and `:description`.

===== Sending an Email

[source,ruby]
----
to = 'pemcg@redhat.com'
from = 'miq01@uk.bit63.com'
subject = 'Test Message'
body = 'What an awesome cloud management product!'
$evm.execute('send_email', to, from, subject, body)
----

Here we define the 'to', 'from', 'subject' and 'body' arguments, and call the `send_email` method.

===== Creating a new automation request

The `create_automation_request` method is new with ManageIQ _Capablanca_, and it enables us to chain automation requests together. This is also very useful when we wish to explicitly launch an automation task in a different zone than the one in which our currently running script resides.

[source,ruby]
----
options = {}
options[:namespace]     = 'Stuff'
options[:class_name]    = 'Methods'
options[:instance_name] = 'MyInstance'
options[:user_id]       = $evm.vmdb(:user).find_by_userid('pemcg').id
# options[:attrs]       = attrs
# options[:miq_zone]    = zone
auto_approve            = true

$evm.execute('create_automation_request', options, 'admin', auto_approve)
----

In this example we define the namespace, class and instance names to be used for the automation request, and we lookup the service model object of the user who we want to run the automation task as. The 'admin' user in the argument list is the _requester_ to be used for approval purposes.

=== $evm.instantiate

We can use `$evm.instantiate` to launch another Automate instance programmatically from a running method, by specifying its URI within the Automate namespace e.g.

[source,ruby]
----
$evm.instantiate('/Discovery/Methods/ObjectWalker')
----

Instances called in this way execute synchronously, so the calling method waits for completion before continuing. The called instance also appears as a child object of the caller (it sees the caller as its `$evm.parent`).

=== Summary

This has been a more theoretical chapter, examining the eight most commonly used `$evm` methods.footnote:[There are a further three state-machine specific $evm methods that we frequently use, but we'll cover those in link:../state_machines/chapter.asciidoc[State Machines]] In our simple scripts so far we have already used three of them; `$evm.log`, `$evm.object` and `$evm.root`. Our next example in link:../enforcing_anti_affinity_rules/chapter.asciidoc[Enforcing Anti-Affinity Rules] uses two others, and we will use the remaining three as we progress through the book. These methods form a core part of our scripting toolbag, their use will become second nature as we advance our automation scripting skills.
