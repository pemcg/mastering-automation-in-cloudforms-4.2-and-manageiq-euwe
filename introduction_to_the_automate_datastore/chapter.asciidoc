== Introduction to the Automate Datastore

When we use the Automate capability of CloudForms/ManageIQ, we write scripts in the Ruby language, and use objects that the _Automation Engine_ makes available to us. The CloudForms/ManageIQ Web User Interface (WebUI) allows us to access the Automate functionality via the *Automate* top-level menu (see <<i1>>).

=== The Automate Explorer

The first menu item that we see takes us to the _Explorer_. This is our visual interface into the _Automate Datastore_, and it contains the various kinds of Automate objects that we'll use throughout this book (see <<i2>>).

Before we start our journey into learning CloudForms/ManageIQ Automate, we'll take a tour of the Automate Datastore to familiarise ourselves with the objects that we'll find there.

=== The Automate Datastore

The Automate Datastore has a directory-like structure, consisting of several types of organisational unit arranged in a hierarchy (see <<i3>>).

[[i3]]

{zwsp} +

We can look at each of these types of object in more detail.

=== Domains

A _domain_ is a collection of namespaces, classes, instances and methods. The ManageIQ project provides a single _ManageIQ_ domain for all supplied automation code, whilst Red Hat adds the supplemental _RedHat_ domain containing added-value code for the CloudForms product. The ManageIQ and RedHat domains are locked, indicating their read-only nature, however we can create new domains for our own custom automation code. <<i2>> shows the default domains, two additional manually-created domains: _Bit63_ and _Debug_, and a Git-imported domain _Investigative_Debugging_. 

Organising our own code into custom domains greatly simplifies the task of exporting and importing code (simplifying code portability and reuse). It also leaves Red Hat or the ManageIQ project free to update the locked domain through minor releases without fear of overwriting our customisations.

[NOTE]
If we are logged into CloudForms/ManageIQ as an account in a child tenant, we may see domains created by a parent tenant in the Automate Datastore, but they will also appear as locked.

==== Domain Priority

User-added domains can be individually enabled or disabled, and can be ordered by priority such that if code exists in the same path in multiple domains (for example _/Cloud/VM/Provisioning/StateMachines_), the code in the highest priority enabled domain will be executed. We can change the priority order of our user-added domains using the *Configuration -> Edit Priority Order of Domains* menu (see <<i4>>).

[[i4]]

==== Importing and Exporting Domains

We can export domains using _rake_ from the command line, and import them either using rake or from the WebUI. (Using rake enables us to specify more import and export options). A typical rake import line is as follows:

....
bin/rake evm:automate:import YAML_FILE=bit63.yaml IMPORT_AS=Bit63 SYSTEM=false \
ENABLED=true DOMAIN=Export PREVIEW=false
....

===== Importing Domains from a Git Repository

CloudForms 4.2/ManageIQ _Euwe_ has introduced the capability to be able to import domains directly from a git repository. We can specify the repository URL and optional credentials at the Import / Export menu, whereupon the repository contents is downloaded to the appliance with the _Git Repositories Owner_ server role set. We can then choose to import from a repository branch or tag (see <<i5>>). 

[[i5]]
.Selecting a branch or tag to import

{zwsp} +

A domain imported from a git repository has a github icon (see <<i2>>), and will be locked. The recommended way of updating code in such a domain is to commit and push an update to the git repository as a new tag or branch, and then update the domain using the *Configuration -> Refresh with a new branch or tag* menu.

==== Copying Objects Between Domains

We frequently need to customise code in one of the the locked domains, for example when implementing our own custom VM Placement method. Fortunately we can easily copy any object from a locked domain into our own, using *Configuration -> Copy this ...* (see <<i6>>).

[[i6]]
.Copying a class

{zwsp} +

When we copy an object such as a class, we are prompted for the *From* and *To* domains. We can optionally deselect *Copy to same path* and specify our own destination path for the object (see <<i7>>).

==== Importing Old Format Exports

Domains were a new feature of the Automate Datastore in CloudForms 3.1/ManageIQ _Anand_. Prior to this release all factory-supplied and user-created automation code was contained in a common structure, which made updates difficult when any user-added code was introduced (the user-supplied modifications needed exporting and reimporting/merging whenever an automation update was released).

To import a Datastore backup from a CloudForms 3.0 and prior format Datastore, we must convert it to the new Datastore format first, like so:

....
cd /var/www/miq/vmdb
bin/rake evm:automate:convert FILE=database.xml DOMAIN=SAMPLE \
ZIP_FILE=/tmp/sample_converted.zip
....

=== Namespaces

A _namespace_ is a folder-like container for classes, instances and methods, and is used purely for organisational purposes. We create namespaces to arrange our code logically and namespaces often contain other namespaces (see <<i8>>).

[[i8]]
.Namespaces
image::images/ss6.png[screenshot,240,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

=== Classes

A _class_ is similar to a template, it contains a generic definition for a set of automation operations. Each class has a schema, that defines the variables, states, relationships or methods that instances of the class will use.

[NOTE]
The Automate Datastore uses object-oriented terminology for these objects. A _class_ is a generic definition for a set of automation operations, and these classes are _instantiated_ as specific instances.
The classes that we work with in the Automate Datastore are not the same as Ruby classes that we work with in our automation scripts.

==== Schemas

A _schema_ is made up of a number of elements, or __fields__, that describe the properties of the class. A schema often has just one entry - to run a single method - but in many cases it has several components. <<i9>> shows the schema for a _placement_ class, which has several different field types.

[[i9]]

{zwsp} +

==== Adding or Editing a Schema 

We add or edit each schema field in the schema editor by specifying the *Type* from a drop-down list (see <<i10>>).

[[i10]]
.Schema field type
image::images/ss8.png[screenshot,500,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

Each field type has an associated *Data Type* which is also selectable from a drop-down list (see <<i11>>).

[[i11]]
.Schema field data type
image::images/ss9.png[screenshot,500,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

CloudForms 4.2/ManageIQ _Euwe_ has introduced several new data types: _Null Coalescing_, _Host_, _Vm_, _Storage_, _Ems_, _Policy_, _Server_, _Request_, _Provision_ and _User_. These will be discussed in a later chapter.

===== Default Values

We can define default values for fields in a class schema. These will be inherited by all instances created from the class, but can be optionally overridden in the schema of any particular instance.

==== Relationships

One of the schema field types is a __relationship__, which links to other instances elsewhere in the Automate Datastore. We often use relationships as a way of chaining instances together, and relationship values can accept variable substitutions for flexibility (see <<i12>>).

[[i12]]
.Relationship fields showing variable substitutions
image::images/ss10.png[screenshot,450,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

=== Instances

An _instance_ is a specific _instantiation_ or "clone" of the generic class, and is the entity run by the Automation Engine. An instance contains a copy of the class schema but with actual values of the fields filled in (see <<i13>>).

[[i13]]
.Single class definition with three instances
image::images/ss11.png[screenshot,280,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

=== Methods

A _method_ is a self-contained block of Ruby code that gets executed when we run any automation operation. A typical method looks like this:

[source,ruby]
....
###################################################################
#
# Description: select the cloud network
#              Default availability zone is provided by Openstack
#
###################################################################

# Get variables
prov  = $evm.root["miq_provision"]
image = prov.vm_template
raise "Image not specified" if image.nil?

if prov.get_option(:cloud_network).nil?
  cloud_network = prov.eligible_cloud_networks.first
  if cloud_network
    prov.set_cloud_network(cloud_network)
    $evm.log("info", "Image=[#{image.name}] Cloud Network=[#{cloud_network.name}]")
  end
end
....

Methods can have one of three _Location_ values: *inline*, *builtin*, or *URI*. In practice most of the methods that we create are *inline* methods, which means they run as a separate Ruby process outside of Rails.

=== Summary

In this chapter we've learned about the fundamental objects or organisational units that we work with in the Automate Datastore: domains, namespaces, classes, instances and methods.

We are now ready to use this information to write our first automation script.
