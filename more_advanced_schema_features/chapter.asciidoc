== More Advanced Schema and Instance Features

Our Automate examples so far have used relatively simple class schema features. We have used the *attribute* and *method* field types, and we've seen how to store attributes as strings or encrypted passwords. We've called our instances using simple URI pathnames such as _/General/Methods/HelloWorld_, and our instances have run single methods. This simple type of schema allows us to create many different and useful instances, but there are times when we need additional flexibility. For example it is sometimes useful to be able to select which of several methods in our schema to run, based on criteria established at runtime.

There are three more class schema features that we can use to extend the usefulness of our instances: _messages_, _assertions_ and _collections_.

=== Messages

Each schema field has a *message* column/value that we can optionally use to identify a particular field to execute or evaluate when we call the instance. We can think of this as a filter to determine which schema values to process.

The default message is __create__, and if we look at the schema that we created for our _/ACME/General/Methods_ class, we see that the default message value of _create_ was automatically set for us for all fields (see <<i1>>).

We specify the message when we create a relationship to an instance, by appending `#message` after the URI to the instance. If we don't explicitly specify a message then `#create` is implicitly used.

For example we could create a relationship to run our first _HelloWorld_ instance, using a URI of either:

....
/ACME/General/Methods/HelloWorld
....

or

....
/ACME/General/Methods/HelloWorld#create
....

In both cases the _hello_world_ method would execute as this is the _method_ schema field "filtered" by the _create_ message.

==== Specifying our own Messages

It can be useful to create a class/instance schema that allows for one of several methods to be executed, depending on the message passed to the instance at runtime. For example the schema for the _/Infrastructure/VM/Provisioning/Placement_ class allows for a provider-specific VM placement algorithm to be created, and selected using a message (see <<i2>>).

[[i2]]

{zwsp} +

We can therefore call any instance of the class as part of the VM provisioning state machine, by appending a message created from a variable substitution corresponding to the provisioning source vendor (i.e. redhat, vmware or microsoft):

....
/Infrastructure/VM/Provisioning/Placement/default#${/#miq_provision.source.vendor}
....

In this way we are able to create a generic class and instance definition that contains several methods, and we can choose which method to run dynamically at run-time by using a message.

=== Assertions

One of the schema field types that we can use is an _assertion_. This is a boolean check that we can put anywhere in our class schema (assertions are always processed first in an instance). If the assertion evaluates to _true_ the remaining instance schema fields are processed. If the assertion evaluates to _false_ the remainder of the instance fields are not processed.

We can see an example of an assertion (called *placement*) at the start of the schema for the _Placement_ class (see <<i2>>). Placement methods are relevant only if the *Automatic* check box has been selected at provisioning time, and this check box sets a boolean value `miq_provision.placement_auto`. The *placement* assertion checks that this value is true, and prevents the remainder of the instance from running if automatic placement has not been selected.

Another use for assertions is to put a "guard" field in an instance whose methods are applicable only to a single provider. For example we might have an instance that configures VMware NSX software defined networking during the provisioning of a virtual machine. The methods would fail if called during an OpenStack provisioning operation, but we can add an assertion field to the instance, as follows:

----
'${/#miq_provision.source.vendor}' == 'VMware'
----

This will return `true` if the provisioning operation is to a VMware provider, but `false` otherwise, so preventing the methods from running in a non-VMware context.

=== Collections

As we have seen, there is a parent-child relationship between the `$evm.root` object (the one whose instantiation took us into the Automation Engine), and subsequent objects created as a result of following schema relationships or by calling `$evm.instantiate`.

If a child object has schema attribute values, it can read or write to them by using its own `$evm.object` hash (e.g. we saw the use of `$evm.object['username']` in link:../using_schema_variables/chapter.asciidoc[Using Schema Variables]). Sometimes we need to propagate these values back up a parent or `$evm.root` object, and we do this using _collections_.

We define a value to collect _from_ our instance in the *Collect* schema column, using this syntax:

----
propagated_variable_name = schema_variable_name
----

If the first variable specified has a leading '/', the value will be propagated up to $evm.root, i.e.

----
/variable_name = schema_variable_name
----

This will then be available to other methods in the workspace as `$evm.root['variable_name']`. If the first variable does not have a leading '/', i.e.

----
variable_name = schema_variable_name
----

This will then be available to a parent instance that called us as `$evm.object['variable_name']`. This second form is most typically used after a method has called another using `$evm.instantiate`. Any variables set by the instantiated instance will be available to the calling method in `$evm.object`.

We can also specify more than one value to collect, by separating values as a semi-colon delimited list, i.e.

----
var1 = schema_var1; var2 = schema_var2
----

This Provisioning Profile has several schema attributes defined, such as **dialog_name** and **auto_approval_state_machine**. The *Collect* value makes these attribute values available to any other method in the workspace as `$evm.root['dialog_name']` and `$evm.root['state_machine']`.

=== Calling a Non-Existent Instance

We can optionally add a _.missing_ instance to a class which will be executed if the actual instance name referenced in a calling URI doesn't exist. This is used in several places in the Automate Datastore, and an example can be seen in the provisioning profile class (see <<i6>>). Group name-specific profiles can be created to handle VM provisioning options on a per-group basis, and a profile for the EvmGroup-super_administrator group is provided out-of-the-box (see link:../the_provisioning_profile/chapter.asciidoc[The Provisioning Profile] for more details). The _.missing_ instance in this class acts as a catch-all profile for those user groups that don't have specifically-defined profiles.

To support the requirements of the new Ansible Tower provider, CloudForms 4.1/ManageIQ _Darga_ extended the .missing functionality to allow the missing instance name to be caught in a variable called `_missing_instance`. This allows us to use the variable in a substitution string as the value of a schema attribute (see <<i7>>).

For example if we were to call the non-existant URI __/ConfigurationManagement/AnsibleTower/Operations/JobTemplate/configure_database_server__, the _.missing_ instance would be run with the *job_template_name* attribute given the run-time value of *configure_database_server*.

=== Summary

This chapter completes our coverage of the objects and techniques that we work with in the Automate Datastore. The schema and instance features that we've learnt about here are used less frequently, but are still very useful tools to have in our scripting toolbag.
