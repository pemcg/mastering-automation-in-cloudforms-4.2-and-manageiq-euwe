== Configuring Virtual Machines

We saw in Part II how we can provision virtual machines from the WebUI. CloudForms 4.1 and ManageIQ _Darga_ have added the ability to be able to launch configuration jobs via Ansible Tower. This enables us to both provision and configure virtual machines from Automate.

In Part III we'll learn about configuring virtual machines using Ansible and Ansible Tower.
