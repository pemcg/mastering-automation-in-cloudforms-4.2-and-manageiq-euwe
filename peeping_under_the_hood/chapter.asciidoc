== Peeping Under the Hood

We've now worked with an Automation Engine object that represents a virtual machine, and we've called one of its methods to add a custom attribute to the VM.

In this chapter we'll take a deeper look at these Automation Engine objects, and at some of the technology that exists behind the scenes in Rails when we run automation scripts. It is useful background information, but can be skipped on first read if required.

=== A Little Rails Knowledge (Goes a Long Way)

Firstly, by way of reassurance...

*We do not need to know Ruby on Rails to write automation scripts*.

It can, however, be useful to have an appreciation of Rails __models__, and how the Automation Engine encapsulates these as Ruby objects that we can program with. The objects represent the things that we are typically interested in when we write automation code, such as VMs, Clusters, Guest Applications, or even Provisioning Requests.

==== Plain Old Ruby

The Ruby scripts that we write are just plain Ruby 2.x, although the Active Support core extensions to Ruby are available if we wish to use them.

[NOTE]
The Active Support extensions can make our lives easier. For example rather than adding math to our automation script to work out the number of seconds in a two-month time span (perhaps to specify a VM retirement period), we can just specify `2.months`.

Our automation scripts access Ruby objects, made available to us by the Automation Engine via the `$evm` variable (`$evm` is described in more detail in <<evm-and-the-workspace>>). Behind the scenes these are Rails objects, which is why having some understanding of Rails can help our investigation into how we can use these objects to our maximum benefit.

==== Model-View-Controller

Rails is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) application footnote:[See also http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails/Getting_Started/Model-View-Controller[Ruby
on Rails/Getting Started/Model-View-Controller]]

{zwsp} +

The _model_ is a representation of the underlying, logical structure of data from the database (which in the case of CloudForms and ManageIQ is PostgreSQL). When writing automation scripts, we work with models extensively (although we may not necessarily realise it).

Rails models are called _active records_. They always have a singular _CamelCase_ name (e.g. GuestApplication), and their corresponding database tables have a plural _snake_case_ name (e.g. guest_applications).

==== Active Record Associations

Active record _associations_ link the models together in one-to-many or one-to-one relationships that allow us to traverse objects.

We can illustrate this by looking at some of the Rails code that defines the _Host_ (i.e. Hypervisor) active record:

[source,ruby]
----
class Host < ActiveRecord::Base
  ...
  belongs_to                :ext_management_system, :foreign_key => "ems_id"
  belongs_to                :ems_cluster
  has_one                   :operating_system, :dependent => :destroy
  has_one                   :hardware, :dependent => :destroy
  has_many                  :vms_and_templates, :dependent => :nullify
  has_many                  :vms
  ...
----

We see that there are several associations from a host object, including to the cluster that it's a member of, and to the virtual machines that run on that
host.

Although these associations are defined in Rails, they are available to us when we work with the corresponding _service model_ objects from the Automation Engine (see <<service-models>>).

==== Rails Helper Methods (.find_by_*) 

Rails does a lot of things to make our lives easier, including dynamically creating __helper methods__. The most useful ones to us as automation scripters are the find_by_columnname methods.

[source,ruby]
----
vm = $evm.vmdb('vm').find_by_name(vm_name)
----

We can `.find_by_` any column name in a database table. For example in PostgreSQL we can look at the _services_ table that represents services created via a service catalog.

....
vmdb_production=# \d services
                                          Table "public.services"
        Column        |            Type             |                 Modifiers
----------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------
 id                   | bigint                      | not null default nextva...
 name                 | character varying(255)      |
 description          | character varying(255)      |
 guid                 | character varying(255)      |
 type                 | character varying(255)      |
 service_template_id  | bigint                      |
 options              | text                        |
 display              | boolean
 ...
....

We see that there is a `description` column, so if we wanted we could call:

[source,ruby]
----
$evm.vmdb('service').find_by_description('My New Service')
----

Earlier versions of Rails also had a `find_all_by_*` helper method that returned all results matching a search. Rails 5 has removed this in favour of `where`, which is now also supported by service models. The syntax of using `where` is as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
$evm.vmdb('service').where(:description =>'My New Service')
----

[NOTE]
`where` returns a list, even if it only finds one item

[[service-models]]
=== Service Models

We saw earlier that Rails data models are called _active records_. We can't access these directly from an automation script, but fortunately most of the useful ones are made available to us as Automation Engine _service model_ objects.

The objects that we work with in the Automation Engine are all service models; instances of an _MiqAeService_ class that abstract and make available to us their corresponding Rails active record.

For example if we're working with a _User_ object (representing a person, such as the owner of a virtual machine), we might access that object in our script via `$evm.root['user']`. This is actually an instance of an _MiqAeServiceUser_ class, which represents the corresponding Rails _User_ Active Record. There are service model objects representing all of the things that we need to work with when we write automation scripts. These include the traditional components in our infrastructure such as virtual machines, hypervisor clusters, operating systems or ethernet adapters, but also the intangible objects such as provisioning requests or automation tasks.

All of the MiqAeService* objects extend a common _MiqAeServiceModelBase_ class that contains some common methods available to all objects, such
as:

....
.tagged_with?(category, name)
.tags(category = nil)
.tag_assign(tag)
....

Many of the service model objects have several levels of superclass, for example:

....
MiqAeServiceManageIQ_Providers_Redhat_InfraManager_ProvisionViaPxe <
    MiqAeServiceManageIQ_Providers_Redhat_InfraManager_Provision <
        MiqAeServiceMiqProvision <
            MiqAeServiceMiqRequestTask <
                MiqAeServiceModelBase
....

==== Service Model Names and Provider Namespacing

The service model names for any provider-specific classes follow the provider namespacing scheme introduced in CloudForms 4.0 (ManageIQ _Capablanca_). This separates the providers in several categories and in the current versions of the tools these categories are as follows:

* CloudManager
* ContainerManager
* ConfigurationManager
* InfraManager
* NetworkManager

The provider-specific service model objects are named in the following way:

....
MiqAeServiceManageIQ_Providers_<ProviderName>_<ProviderCategory>_<ProviderObject>
....
For example the service model object name for an OpenStack cloud subnet is:
....
MiqAeServiceManageIQ_Providers_Openstack_NetworkManager_CloudSubnet
....
The object name for a VMware ESX host is:
....
MiqAeServiceManageIQ_Providers_Vmware_InfraManager_HostEsx
....

[NOTE]
====
The pre-CloudForms 4.0 provider-specific service model names have been retained for backwards compatibility, so for now we can still use a command such as:

....
$evm.vmdb(:CloudSubnet).all
....
====

=== Service Model Object Properties

The service model objects that the Automation Engine makes available to us have four properties that we frequently work with, _attributes_, _virtual columns_, _associations_ and _methods_.

==== Attributes

Just like any other Ruby object, the service model objects that we work with have _attributes_ that we often use. A service model object represents a record in a database table, and the object's attributes correspond to the columns in the table for that record.

For example, some attributes for a RHEV Host (i.e. Hypervisor) object (the `MiqAeServiceManageIQ_Providers_Redhat_InfraManager_Host` service model), with typical values, are:

....
host.connection_state = connected
host.created_on = 2014-11-13 17:53:34 UTC 
host.ems_cluster_id = 1000000000001
host.ems_id = 1000000000001
host.ems_ref = /api/hosts/b959325b-67-4e3a-a52e-fd936c225a1a 
host.ems_ref_obj = /api/hosts/b959325b-67-4e3a-a52e-fd936c225a1a
host.guid = fcea82c8-6b5d-11e4-98ac-001a4aa01599
host.hostname = 192.168.1.224
host.hyperthreading = nil
host.id = 1000000000001 
host.ipaddress = 192.168.1.224
host.last_perf_capture_on = 2015-06-05 10:25:46 UTC 
host.name = rhelh03.bit63.net
host.power_state = on
host.settings = {:autoscan=>false, :inherit_mgt_tags=>false, :scan_frequency=>0}
host.smart = 1
host.type = HostRedhat
host.uid_ems = b959325b-67-4e3a-a52e-fd936c225a1a
host.updated_on = 2015-06-05 10:43:00 UTC
host.vmm_product = rhel
host.vmm_vendor = RedHat
....

We can enumerate an object's attributes using:

[source,ruby]
----
this_object.attributes.each do |key, value|
----

==== Virtual Columns

In addition to the standard object attributes (which correspond to 'real' database columns), Rails dynamically adds a number of _virtual columns_ to many of the service models.

[NOTE]
A virtual column is a computed database column that is not physically stored in the table. Virtual columns often contain more dynamic values than attributes, such as the number of VMs currently running on a hypervisor.

Some virtual columns for our same RHEV Host object, with typical values, are:

....
host.authentication_status = Valid
host.derived_memory_used_avg_over_time_period = 790.1026640002773
host.derived_memory_used_high_over_time_period = 2586.493300608264
host.derived_memory_used_low_over_time_period = 0
host.os_image_name = linux_generic
host.platform = linux
host.ram_size = 15821
host.region_description = Region 1
host.region_number = 1
host.total_cores = 4
host.total_vcpus = 4
host.v_owning_cluster = Default
host.v_total_miq_templates = 0
host.v_total_storages = 3
host.v_total_vms = 7
....

We access theses virtual columns just as we would access attributes, using "object.virtual_column_name" syntax. If we want to enumerate through all of an object's virtual columns getting the corresponding values, we must use `.send`, specifying the virtual column name, like so:

[source,ruby]
----
this_object.virtual_column_names.each do |virtual_column_name|
  virtual_column_value = this_object.send(virtual_column_name)
----

==== Associations

We saw earlier that there are associations between many of the Active Records (and hence service models), and we use these extensively when scripting.

For example we can discover more about the hardware of our virtual machine (VM) by following associations between the VM object (`MiqAeServiceManageIQ_Providers_Redhat_InfraManager_Vm`), and its Hardware and GuestDevice objects (`MiqAeServiceHardware` and `MiqAeServiceGuestDevice`), as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
hardware = $evm.root['vm'].hardware
hardware.guest_devices.each do |guest_device|
  if guest_device.device_type == "ethernet"
    nic_name = guest_device.device_name
  end
end
----

Fortunately we don't need to know anything about the Active Records or service models behind the scenes, we just magically follow the association. See link:../investigative_debugging/chapter.asciidoc[Investigative Debugging] to find out what associations there are to follow.

Continuing our exploration of our RHEV Host object, the associations available to this object are:

....
host.datacenter
host.directories
host.ems_cluster
host.ems_events
host.ems_folder
host.ext_management_system
host.files
host.guest_applications
host.hardware
host.lans
host.operating_system
host.storages
host.switches
host.vms
....

We can enumerate an object's associations using:

[source,ruby]
----
this_object.associations.each do |association|
----

==== Methods

Most of the objects that we work with have useful methods defined that we can use, either in their own class or one of their parent superclasses. For example the methods available to call for our RHEV Host object are:

....
host.authentication_password
host.authentication_userid
host.credentials
host.current_cpu_usage
host.current_memory_headroom
host.current_memory_usage
host.custom_get
host.custom_keys
host.custom_set
host.domain
host.ems_custom_get
host.ems_custom_keys
host.ems_custom_set
host.event_log_threshold?
host.get_realtime_metric
host.scan
host.ssh_exec
host.tagged_with?
host.tags
host.tag_assign
....

Enumerating a service model object's methods is more challenging, because the actual object that we want to enumerate is running in the Automation Engine on the remote side of a dRuby call (see below), and all we have is the local DRb::DRbObject accessible from `$evm`. We can use `method_missing`, but we get returned the entire method list, which includes attribute names, virtual column names, association names, superclass methods, and so on.

[source,ruby]
----
this_object.method_missing(:class).instance_methods
----

=== Distributed Ruby

The Automation Engine runs in a CloudForms/ManageIQ _worker_ thread, and it launches one of our automation scripts by spawning it as a child Ruby process. We can see this from the command line using *`ps`* to check the PID of the worker processes and its children:


----
\_ /var/www/miq/vmdb/lib/workers/bin/worker.rb
|   \_ /opt/rh/rh-ruby22/root/usr/bin/ruby  <-- automation script running
----

An automation script runs in its own process space, but it must somehow access the service model objects that reside in the Automation Engine process. It does this using Distributed Ruby.

.Examining CloudForms/ManageIQ Workers

We can use `rake evm:status` to see which workers are running on a CloudForms or ManageIQ appliance:

----

...

 MiqWebServiceWorker                                               | started |
----
****

Distributed Ruby (dRuby) is a distributed client-server object system that allows a client Ruby process to call methods on a Ruby object located in another (server) Ruby process. This can even be on another machine.

The object in the remote dRuby server process is locally represented in the dRuby client by an instance of a _DRb::DRbObject_ object. In the case of an automation script, this object is our `$evm` variable.

The Automation Engine cleverly handles everything for us. When it runs our automation script, the Engine sets up the dRuby session automatically, and we access all of the service model objects seamlesssly via `$evm` in our script. Behind the scenes the dRuby library handles the TCP/IP socket communication with the dRuby server in the worker running the Automation Engine.

We gain insight into this if we examine some of these `$evm` objects using `object_walker`, for example:

....
$evm.root['user'] => #<MiqAeMethodService::MiqAeServiceUser:0x0000000c5431c8>   \
                            (type: DRb::DRbObject, URI: druby://127.0.0.1:38842)
....

Although the use of dRuby mostly transparent to us, it can occasionally produce unexpected results. Perhaps we are hoping to find some useful user-related method that we can call on our user object, which we know we can access as `$evm.root['user']`. We might try to call a standard Ruby method such as:

[source,ruby]
----
$evm.root['user'].instance_methods
----

If we were to do this we would actually get a list of the instance methods for the local _DRb::DRbObject_ object, rather than the remote MiqAeServiceUser service model; probably not what we want.

When we get more adventurous in our scripting, we also occasionally get a _DRb::DRbUnknown_ object returned to us, indicating that the class of the object is unknown in our dRuby client's namespace.

=== Summary

This chapter has given us some good insight into the Rails active records that CloudForms/ManageIQ uses internally to represent our virtual infrastructure, and how these are made available to us as service model objects. We've also seen how these service model objects have four specific properties that we frequently make use of: attributes, virtual columns, associations and methods.
