== Provisioning a Virtual Machine

One of the most common things that we do as cloud or virtualisation administrators is to create new virtual machines or instances. We get used to the procedure; picking a template, selecting a target cluster, datastore and network, choosing a suitable name. These are generally manual steps, but CloudForms and ManageIQ have an out-of-the-box virtual machine provisioning workflow that automates the process.

There are many steps involved in automatically provisioning a virtual machine. The provisioning workflow has been designed to be extremely flexible, and allows a great deal of customisation based on tagging, the requesting user's group membership, and the destination Provider type (e.g. RHEV, VMware, OpenStack, etc.). 

=== The Provisioning Process

The virtual machine provisioning process starts with a user (the _requester_) selecting either *Provision VMs* from under the *Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines -> Lifecycle* button group, or *Provision Instances* or from under the *Cloud -> Instances -> Lifecycle* button group(see <<i1>>).

This takes us into a selection dialog where we pick an image or template to provision from, and click the *Continue* button (see <<i2>>).

Once we click **Continue**, we enter into the virtual machine provisioning workflow, starting with information retrieved from the _profile_ and moving into the _state machine_.

=== Group-Specific Considerations, and Common Processing

Provisioning a virtual machine or instance involves many separate decisions, and steps that come together to form the VM provisioning workflow.

Some of these steps need to be performed or evaluated within the context of the requesting user's access control group membership, such as the choice of provisioning dialog to present to the user in the WebUI. We may for example, wish to customise the WebUI dialog to present a restricted set of options to certain groups of users (see also link:../the_provisioning_dialog/chapter.asciidoc[The Provisioning Dialog]). We can decide to apply quotas to access control groups, or create specific customisations such as group-specific virtual machine naming schemes. Group-specific processing is typically performed in _Request_ context, before the _Tasks_ are created (see link:../requests_and_tasks/chapter.asciidoc[Requests and Tasks] for a description of requests and tasks).

Other steps in the virtual machine provisioning workflow are common to all virtual machine or instance provisioning operations. These typically include the allocation of an IP address, registration with a CMDB, or emailing the requester that the provision has completed for example.

The group-specific _Provisioning Profile_ contains the per-group attributes, instance and state machine names that are used in processing the provisioning _Request_, and in preparing the provisioning _Task(s)_.

The more generic sequence of common steps involved in provisioning a virtual machine or instance come from the _VM Provisioning State Machine_. This is processed in the context of the provisioning _Task_.

=== Summary

This short chapter has introduced the group-specific provisioning profile and the
more generic VM provisioning state machine that combine to form the virtual
machine provisioning workflow.

In the following chapters, we will examine these in more detail, starting with the provisioning profile.
